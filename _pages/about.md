I am a Political Science researcher and educator specializing in the intersection of caste, business, and social structures in India. Currently, I am completing my PhD at the Centre for Political Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, where my research explores how caste networks influence business dynamics in Delhi, particularly focusing on Vaishya and Dalit communities.

## Research Focus

My academic work examines the complex relationships between social structures, economic systems, and political frameworks in India. I am particularly interested in:

* Political Economy
* Indian Political System
* Research Methodology
* Constitutional Studies
* Inclusive Public Policy

## Academic Journey

My journey in political science began at Fergusson College, Pune, where I developed a strong foundation in political theory. This led me to pursue my MA at JNU's Centre for Political Studies, followed by an MPhil from the University of Hyderabad, where I researched "Dalits, Modernity and Capitalism in India."

## Teaching Experience

As a Visiting Faculty member at Delhi Metropolitan Education's Department of Law, I teach Political Science courses to students in the integrated BA LLB program. My teaching approach emphasizes interactive methods to help students engage with complex concepts in:

* Political Theory
* Political Systems
* International Relations
* Indian Constitution

## Recent Recognition

I was honored to receive the Best Paper Award at the 1st Global Conference on Caste, Business and Society at the University of Cambridge's Judge Business School in June 2023. This recognition reflects my commitment to producing meaningful research that contributes to our understanding of social and economic structures in India.

## Current Research

My doctoral research, titled "Caste Networks in Indian Business: A Comparative Study of Vaishyas and Dalits in Delhi," examines how traditional social structures continue to influence modern economic relationships. This work builds on my previous publications, including articles in Prabuddha: Journal of Social Equality and the Indian Journal of Dalit and Tribal Studies and Action.
