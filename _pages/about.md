I serve as a Research Associate at [Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems, Indian Institute of Science](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/). My current project revolves around application of generative modelling in Energy Time series datasets. 
 
My educational background includes an M.Sc. in Data Science from  [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/). 
I have over 3 years of combined industry and research experience, I previously served as an ML Engineer at [Cloudaeye](https://www.cloudaeye.com/), a startup based in Silicon Valley. During my time there, I applied machine learning techniques to provide solutions for detecting anomalies and performing root cause analyses in cloud-native applications. My research journey encompasses various publications on subjects such as interpretable AI, energy prediction, generative modeling, and anomaly detection. 

Before my current role, I was a Research Associate at [FLAME University's](https://www.flame.edu.in/) Centre for Mathematical Modelling, where I worked on projects related to explainable AI, generative modeling, and genetic algorithms. Additionally, I contributed as a Teaching Assistant, instructing courses in computational modeling, quantitative analysis, and machine learning. I also actively mentored undergraduates in their research, helping them develop and execute their project ideas.


### 🙌🔬 Collaborations and Projects
My work with [Dr. Pandarasamy Arjunan](https://www.samy101.com/) has been instrumental in applying machine learning methodologies for optimizing building energy management. In collaboration with [Dr. Jayaraman Valadi](https://www.flame.edu.in/faculty/jayaraman-v-k), I have delved into  projects revolving around explainable AI, genetic algorithms, and generative modeling.  Additionally, my reserch internship at CMI under [Dr. Venkatesh Vinayakarao](http://vvtesh.co.in/) involved implementing  topic modeling to align functionality scripts with documentation for a distinguished software company.

### 😊 Reserch Interests

My research interests focus on deep learning and generative modeling, with an emphasis on its applications, such as anomaly detection, among others. Furthermore, I have a keen interest in areas like model interpretability and representation learning.
